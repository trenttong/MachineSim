It is clear that objects have a much shorter life time than the LLC cache that hold them.

It is fair to assume that the lifetime of the object is 1M cycles while the cache eviction cycles in LLC is 10M cycles.




Early Death Detection

- Mechanism to be built to detect death of an object.
	- special instructions.
	- notify the cache to evict.
		- problem with this is that the death of the object are too infrequent in 
		  comparison to eviction.

		  i.e. there are 1M evictions happened in the level 1 cache. but many of
		  which are NOT evicted by dead object. assuming the death object hinted
		  eviction is always correct. the fact that it only consistitues a small
		  portion of the evictions make it less effective. 
		  e.g. eviction happens 40 instructions on level 1 cache. but average life
		  time of objects are 2000 or more instructions.
		  
	          measurements taken on specjbb indicate that dead object hinted eviction
		  always outperforms unhinted eviction. but only MARGINALLY ...

		  this is better for level 2 and level 3 cache, as they tend to have a
		  longer eviction cycle. however, not by too much. i.e. level 3 cache
		  has a 1.5MPKI == 660 cycles per evictions.

		  However, there is another factor to taken into account here. i.e. the
		  eviction guided by LRU is already good. Therefore, to get any improvement
                  the dead object guided eviction has to be better than a already state-of-art
		  replacement policy.

	- hardware changes may be hard.
	- another thing found was large number of short lived object only exists in certain (3/~12) benchmarks.

	Conclusion: dead object guided eviction does not deliver significant improvement over LRU. Therefore, it is
	not a direction to pursue.
		  


Early Death Prediction

- Nursery has a low suvival rate.
- make caching for nursery easier to evict.

   	- the garbage collector tells the address of the nursery heap.
   	- put a bit in cache to tell whether it is cache an object from the nursery.
   	- replacement the cache line more actively.

   	- the garbage collector estimate the lifetime of the objects.
   	- the garbage collector hints the cache what the average survival rate of objects on the nursery and the cache 
     	  adjust replacement accordingly. 

	- same problem here. how much can this outperform LRU ...
